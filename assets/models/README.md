# Body Models

Place your local GLB files here for the Training Body Fat Visualizer:

- assets/models/body-male.glb
- assets/models/body-female.glb

Notes:
- Keep models upright (Y-up), centered near world origin.
- Real-world scale is recommended (about 1.7m tall).
- If a file is missing, the page will show a fallback procedural body.
